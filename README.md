# Institutional Support Boilerplate templates for OMOP Implementers

Welcome! 

This all started with 2025 Trump Administration funding caps on the NIH down to 15%. We need to collaborate quickly to support one another's implementations of OMOP, so I put together some boilerplate. As always, and in OHDSI fashion, this is absolutely open to contribution, comment, and feedback.

## Contribution Guidelines
Feel free to fork and contribute back up via PR! I'm also open to pushing to a central repo managed elsewhere by likeminded group of folks. The only point to consider for contribution to the current repo is that this is Apache-2.0 licenced, so contributions should be pretty permissive
