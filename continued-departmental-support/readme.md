# Purpose
This was created at Emory University to encourage ongoing support for the OMOP-CDM. As we are an established site with a number of projects, we highlight specific projects and provided metrics to local stakeholders. For this general template, we kept the project themes, but encourage you to include specifics that matter to your leadership.

## Collaboration
We encourage you to modify the following Google document version to your heart's content. Some versions will get pushed to a more stable docx version, or md.
